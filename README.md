# Introduction
CLD is a system for differentiating access to to servers and scripts with the ability to quickly implement custom modules and automation tools.
All of toolkit available though several user interfaces: CLI, API, Web based terminal, Chat bots (Discord, Telegram, MatterMost, Slack), also it have simple web interface for administration purposes.
The project aims to combine all the technologies used in one centralized and self-documented place, with secure, transparent and logged access to any server and tool through several user interfaces at once.

It's developed it in accordance with the most principles and rules of the "Unix" philosophy, the system is based on shell utilities and additional user interfaces (Web, API, Telegram, Discord, Mattermost, Slack) in Python, each of the utilities connects a basic micro library and performs a specific task, together they form the logical core.
All data is stored in text files with limited access, the kernel, in turn, supports working with modules.
Each module can contain: utilities, additional user interface plugins, a readme file, an auditor file (if the module requires a separate watchdog), and module initialization scripts.
All module components are automatically parsed by the corresponding kernel components and connected to the system, the Readme file is also parsed and help output of available utilities by blocks (description, arguments, usage examples) for subsequent automatic generation of project documentation.

Additional user interfaces are a generic authorization tool for using kernel utilities and modules.
When the system is initialized, validation methods are generated in each additional interface to be able to use all detected scripts.
Then any existing or custom CLI scripts also can be used in the browser through the web interface console, via the API and via the chat bot in supported messengers.

The web interface contains section of the terminal in the browser with the ability to upload and download files from any instance and an administration section available to users with the admin role
The web interface also provides module sections if the module has web interface support.

When accessing the system, PAM authentication and trusted lists of IP addresses are primarily used at the OS and web server level, authorization of access to the tool uses several validation factors at the application / web server level and / or at the system level (sudoers file generated based on the matrix access), any available module or tool can be shared for use by a specific user through any available interface, excluding direct user access to script code, module content, and the entire system directory.

The access module provides the basis for project security.
It provides users with the ability to generate personal VPN keys and update IP addresses from which trusted lists for instances are compiled in accordance with the network security policy mode.
Module is also responsible for centralized management of SSH keys and deployment to remote servers of trusted lists and firewall rules (iptables) to close sensitive(or all non open) ports with the ability to fine-tune for individual instances or groups.

Documentation itself plays an important role in the project. Each new tool and module is included in the automatically generated documentation, which allows you to avoid losing information about its purpose and reduce the cost of communication in the team.

# Use cases
Here are a few of the many use cases with a brief description to visualize the application of the system.

The CLD usage example screencasts below use the following software:
- Termius as an SSH client
- Chromium based browser
- Telegram messenger client

## Centralized access system
The basis of the project is a centralized system of SSH access based on PAM:

- all CLD users work according to the internal access matrix and have customizable permissions, they can be assigned personal Messenger account id, as well as API token
- each user is authorized on the server to his PAM account
- access to allowed servers is carried out using a single private SSH key or instance password
- the list of servers allowed for connection for the user is determined both by specifying specific instances and according to the groups which shared for a user
- SSH-key and passwords, with the help of which authorization takes place on remote nodes are not available to the user, respectively, this data is reliably protected and cannot be compromised

This video example shows how a user tries to access instances, demonstrates how admin using a dashboard shares one instance for the user, and then a group of instances, also demonstrates the operation of an interactive SSH gate


## Protection of all servers on any hosting
Access to all servers is protected by trusted IP address lists

- access to the CLD management server (as well as to all instances connected to the system) can be limited by the list of allowed ip addresses (access lists)
- the access module provides the ability to update user addresses using a bot in messengers (telegram, discord, mattermost, slack)
- users can generate their personal VPN key to access the CLD server and instances
- trusted lists are deployed by cron, as well as by watcher after changes in the lists on the CLD server
- the list of protected ports is configurable, and separate port lists can be configured for any group or instances
- network security policy across all instances works in 3 mods: general, private and paranoid
  - general - all CLD users trusted IP addresses have network access to all protected ports at instances - default value
  - private - specific network permission policy for each instance in accordance with the access map
  - paranoid - as "private", but all external connections to the CLD server are closed, even for `/api/all`, updating the trusted IP address is possible only through a VPN connection, an established SSH connection through the CLI and through a messenger with IP- address as an argument

This demonstration shows a user trying to connect to the server, the connection is refused until the user adds his ip address through the bot in the messenger using the link in the api containing the generated one-time token


## CloudFlare integration

- Viewing, editing and deleting DNS records of any domain with the ability to enable proxying at any CLD interface
- Ability to set any CloudFlare settings for the domain, as well as reset the CDN cache
- Backing up DNS zones of all connected accounts
- Bulk domains switching from one IP address to another with auto detection of which domains are directed to the current IP address
- Support tools for viewing geo and whois
- Tool for mass issuance of wildcard certificates for all domains in all connected CloudFlare accounts

In order to demonstrate the equivalent use of different interfaces, a user views value of DNS record for a domain in terminal, then deletes it in a messenger using chat bot and sets DNS record to a different type of address in the terminal

- All file operations performed by the user are logged to `/var/cld/log/session/$user/$date/$instance_sftp_$time.gz`
- There are 2 utilities, cld-mount (interactive) and cldxmount (the first instance is selected after filtering)
- Custom mount functions provide file access for any kind of servers, containers, and so on by any protocols
- This tool provides the ability to copy / sync / move data between servers without direct access in between

The current example shows how the user mounts the file system of the remote server, checks the mount status in the command line interface and checks the access to files through the SFTP client connected to the CLD server

- Group type "parsing" have custom script, it will continuously synchronize instance list to group, so you always have single point access to all your infrastructure instances wherever it are
- Parsing any public cloud providers fully customizable - it can use API or CLI third party tools installed on CLD server, parsing script have not limited at all
- Built-in parsing groups: AWS cloud, Google cloud, Hetzner cloud, DigitalOcean, Azure cloud, Scaleway cloud, OVH cloud, Proxmox LXC containers, Docker containers, Kubernetes containers
- The group parsing model combines well with various automation and security tools, as well as with continuously trusted IP lists deploy and SSH authorized keys deploy

The video demonstrates how the user checks the list of instances in the Hetzner group, then activates the group type parsing with the corresponding script in the CLD admin panel, creates a new cloud in the Hetzner Cloud panel, once the server is created, it can be accessed from the CLD

  - tools `bin/cld-*`
  - custom methods of the interfaces `./{api,bot,web}.py`
  - custom WEB interface files `web/${module}.html`, `web/content/somefile.{css,js,svg}` and so on
  - documentation file `./README.md`
  - data of custom modules is recommended to be stored in the directory ./data
- Custom methods of the module interfaces can be related to each other, for example, as it is implemented in the built-in access module
- Module tools can be written in any programming language, including compiled ones
- The CLD interfaces code for the standard launch of the module's tools is generated automatically when the systemd interfaces services are restarted, as well as the code of the user methods is parsing and loading into the interfaces automatically

## User
PAM user on the CLD server created through the `cld-useradd` utility, file-related to CLD (`/var/cld/creds/passwd`, `/var/cld/access/users/${CLD_USER}/`)
  User passwd string have such format: `Username`:`UserMessangerIds`:`ApiToken`:`Modules`:`Tools`:`Groups`
  Regardless of the role, it can contain:
- individual list of instances `/var/cld/access/users/${CLD_USER}/clouds` (optional)

## User role
Roles:
- admin - full access to modules and all tools, the role is defined in the access matrix by the presence of the ALL pattern in columns 4 (modules) and 5 (tools) (userexample:::ALL:ALL)

- custom WEB interface files `./web/${module}.html`, `./web/content/somefile.{css,js,svg}` and so on
- documentation file `./README.md`
- data of custom modules is recommended to be stored in the directory `./data`

A module with demo data/scripts can be created in the web interface using the `Create module` item or with the interactive CLI command `cld-createmodule`

## Tool/Script
CLI tool - is a script of the main/additional or custom module, named `cld-${TOOL}`
The script is also translated for use through the rest of the interfaces available in the CLD.
Detailed information on the available scripts included in the modules "from the box" is available at https://classicdevops.com/documentation

## Interface
CLD interfaces are methods of using tools or any additional functionality
CLD standard interfaces:
- CLI - the main working interface, the use of the interface is available through the shell Linux console, the connection is made via SSH, it is also possible to use it via a web terminal as part of the WEB interface
- API - interface for accessing non-interactive scripts, access to scripts is validated by access lists and the user's personal token, additional arguments are translated as is, an example of use is `curl -s" https://yourcld.server.com/api/modules?token=y0urUserT0keN&args=-json"`, endpoints like `/api/all/` do not have validation by access lists, for example, they are used in `cld-myip`
- BOT - an interface in the chat bot format for accessing non-interactive scripts, convenient for using when managing DNS, access lists, backup reports and so on, an example of use is `/setdns a subdomain.example.com 1.2.3.4`, at the moment are `Telegram`, `Discord`, `MatterMost` and `Slack` integrations are supported
- WEB - interface for access to any, including interactive scripts (using a web terminal), as well as to additional methods of system management, access is validated by access ip lists and by PAM for CLD users, the interface is available at the address - `https://yourcld.server.com/`

## Framework
As per definition from wikipedia
`Framework - a software platform that defines the structure of a software system; software that facilitates the development and integration of different components of a large software project.`
The project is a kind of access and automation framework.
To ensure the standard structure of the tools is used, the main bash library `/var/cld/bin/include/cldfuncs`, connected in all the built-in tools, through the functions of this library, help unification is organized and, accordingly, general autodocumentation using the doc module for generating json and rendering via Redoc, as well as various auxiliary functions, access control, security, etc.


# Centralized access system
The basis of the project is a centralized system of SSH access based on PAM:
- all CLD users work according to the internal access matrix and have customizable permissions, they can be assigned personal messenger account id, as well as API token
- each user is authorized on the server to his PAM account
- access to allowed servers is carried out using a single private SSH key or instance password
- the list of servers allowed for connection for the user is determined both by specifying specific instances and according to the groups which shared for a user
- SSH-key and passwords, with the help of which authorization takes place on remote nodes - are not available to the user, respectively, this data is reliably protected and cannot be compromised
- access to the CLD management server (as well as to other nodes connected to the system) can be limited by the list of allowed ip addresses (access lists)
- the formation of lists of IP addresses allowed for access is carried out using the chat bot together with API, or through the built-in CLI utility
- in the process of working through the CLD, when connecting to the server, its root file system is mounted in `~/mnt/$instance`, this provides file access to the user to any available server through a single SFTP connection, as well as transfer and synchronization of files between servers without the need to create new ones direct connections
- servers are divided into groups, available group types: manual and parsing
- groups of type manual contain servers added manually
- groups of the parsing type contain servers updated through an automatic parsing script that works via API, or in another way, for example, supported from aws, digitalocean, google cloud deployments, or parsing KVM/LXC containers of a group of available hypervisors
- for any group of servers, the functions of connecting to the terminal, mounting the file system and deployment can be separately configured
- currently 2 roles are available:
  - **admin** - `unlimited access` to all CLD components and modules.
  - **user** - `customizable access` to servers, server groups, utilities and modules.
- the console output of all connections to the system's servers is logged into the session log, it is possible to track what the user performed, as well as what he saw in the console at any time in any session, the ability to view current sessions is also available, this allows you to see on the screen the same thing that he sees user, for example it can be useful for L3/L2 engineers to help L2/L1 engineers with technical questions.

# Interfaces:
## CLI
The main interface for working with the CLD system, many main scripts have support for working in an interactive mode designed to work through the CLI
- CLI launch is validated by user aliases in `~/.bashrc`
- Each alias contains sudo launch
- List of aliases and allowed CLD utilities in `/etc/sudoers` - generated by the `cld-initpasswd` utility according to the access matrix `/var/cld/creds/passwd`
- When a module is enabled for a user, all the utilities of the module are added to the aliases and `/etc/sudoers` of this user

## API 
Interface for accessing non-interactive tools via Web API:
- The interface code is written in `Python`, using the `Flask` framework
- Request example: `https://cld.example.com/api/${TOOL}?token=${USER_TOKEN}&args=${ARGUMENTS}`
- User tokens are stored in the file `/var/cld/creds/passwd` and are available to each user in the profile section of the web interface
- At the time of the request, the execution of the utility is initiated with the arguments provided in the request
- Required get arguments:
  - `token` - API token key of CLD user
- Available get arguments:
  - `args` - command line arguments will pass to the CLD tool as is via symbols regex filter
  - `output` - "plain" or "html" - if "html" value will convert color console output to color html - default is plain
  - `mode` - example `?token=${USER_TOKEN}&args=${ARGUMENTS}&mode=track`
    - "stream" - output will streaming line by line in realtime so you can watch progress but response code will always 200 - default value
    - "track" - output as plain/text will available only after CLD tool work done, response code depend on CLD tool return code:
      - if CLD tool return code is 0 (no errors) - API response code will 200
      - otherwise response code will 500 - can be useful for CI/CD systems to track status of API request
- Custom endpoint and API functions available
- When starting the API interface (`systemd` service `cld-api`), the following is executed:
  - Search for all available utilities and generate code for each utility with the appropriate endpoint (truncated by "cld-" in the name)
  - Search for api.py files in the root of each module, this code is executed as is, as part of the entire interface
- An example of using custom endpoints and functions can be viewed in the access module - file `/var/cld/modules/access/api.py`
- Location `/api/`:
  - Available only at addresses allowed through the access module in the system
  - Endpoint autogeneration for utilities occurs for this location
  - The file with allowed ip addresses for `nginx` is generated in the file `/etc/nginx/accesslist`
- Location `/api/all/`:
  - Available for all types of addresses, except those in the prohibited list
  - Can only be used for custom endpoints
    - An example of use is presented in the above api.py access module file
  - The number of requests for location `/api/all/` has a limit of `60 requests per minute`

## Bot
Telegram/Discord/MatterMost/Slack chat bot interface for executing utilities in non-interactive mode:
- Interface code for each chat bot interface in `Python`.
- When sending a command to the chat/bot, it is directly executed with the passed arguments
- Example of command execution: `/command arguments` (first symbol can be different at MatterMost and Slack)
- Access at the application level is validated based on the messendger id of users specified in the file `/var/cld/creds/passwd`
- Output from the utility execution is made in real time by updating the bot's response message
- When starting the BOT interface (`systemd` service `cld-bot`), the following is executed:
   - Search for all available utilities and generate code for each utility with the corresponding command (by analogy with the API, "cld-" in the name is truncated)
  - Search for bot.py files in the root of each module, this code is executed as is, as part of the whole interface
- Custom commands and functions of the Bot interface are available
- An example of using custom commands and functions can be viewed in the access module - file `/var/cld/modules/access/bot.py`
- To share individual modules/utilities for a whole chat, you need to create a separate user in the CLD and assign it the chat id of this group

## Web
Auxiliary interface for working with the system
- The interface code is written in `Python` using the `Flask` framework as well as the `SocketIO` module
- Provides many system management functions
- Has access to all CLI elements including interactively
  - Web terminal in the browser is implemented using `XtermJS` and `SocketIO`
- Allows you to work with the system via web terminal without using SSH client at all
- When starting the WEB interface (`systemd` service `cld-web`), the following is executed:
  - Search for all available utilities and generate code for each utility with the corresponding endpoint
  - Search for web.py files in the root of each module, this code is executed as is, as part of the whole interface
    - When web.py is found at the root of a module, a symlink is created to the `/var/cld/web/modules/${MODULE}/web` directory along the path `/var/cld/web/modules/${MODULE}` to access the static files of the module outside the Flask directory of the application
- Each displayed block of the module on the main page of the interface is generated when web.py is detected and leads to the index endpoint specified by web.py in the module code
  - The name and description of modules are read from the properties of the webmodule object specified in the web.py file of each module, you can see as an example in the documentation module - file `/var/cld/modules/doc/web.py`
  - The module logo is displayed if found at `/var/cld/web/modules/${MODULE}/content/logo.svg`, otherwise a standard image is displayed
- As the text editor in the web interface uses the [Ace Cloud9 Editor](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace), it comes with the following license:

## Access validation factors for each interface:
- **CLI** - `PAM authorization`, `access module`, `access matrix` and `sudoers`
- **API** - `token/access module`, `access list` at the nginx level, `access matrix` and `sudoers`
- **Bot** - `userid`, `permissions matrix` and `sudoers`
- **Web** - `cookie`, `access module`, `access list` at the nginx level, `access matrix` and `sudoers`

Thus, the main priorities of CLD are the safety of users and maintained servers, unprecedented transparency work of engineers, increasing the efficiency of personnel, as well as automation of processes and work scenarios.

# Modular concept
The internal structure of the CLD includes a system of modules that allows you to significantly expand the basic functionality and provide the ability to quickly integrate with external services. Below is a list and brief description of several built-in modules:
- `access` - control access to network ports by allowed/denied address lists on all servers
- `backup` - backup of CLD instances files, databases and configurations
- `cm` - create/manage/migrate KVM to Proxmox Virtual Environment
- `deploy` - deploy bash scripts with support for backups, tests and everything you need to deploy thousands of servers
- `dns` - CloudFlare integration and DNS management across multiple accounts
- `doc` - core of self-documenting system concept - generating documentation based on parsing readme files and help information of all existing modules and scripts

The system is designed in such a way that the addition of new functional modules for any purpose occurs as quickly as possible due to unification and automatic code generation for API and messenger bots, already now in production on a number of projects up to one hundred local modules are used that provide the most diverse functionality and automation, in including complex CI/CD.
Access to modules via CLI, Chat bots, API and via the web interface is separately configured for each user.

# Framework
`CLD` it's home for all your infrastructure scripts where it's always at hand

CLD framework script is:
- Available through various CLI, API, Chat bot, Web - in accordance with the `access matrix` and `allowed lists` of ip addresses
- Has a generated help for all interfaces from one or more variables specified at the beginning of the script (`HELP_DESC`, `HELP_ARGS`, `HELP_EXAMPLES`)
- Securely shared separately or as part of the entire module for any user (including messenger user or group chat)
- Easily used in API for example for build/deployment in the pipeline (API works in stream mode - new lines are displayed in the response as they are executed)
- Over time, new scripts of local modules are developed faster and faster using a similar structure and framework functions
- Works reliably and securely - due to unification and security features, there is no need for hardcode even with tight deadlines
- The script can be in any language (including compiled ones) - it will also be available through any interface (do not forget to write help available through the -h argument for access through the web interface)
- Can be set to cron, for example, to update groups of instances (centralized release and further renewal of certificates on balancers), as well as for monitoring/parsing and sequential start/restart of various services on groups of instances in complex systems with a regulated startup protocol)

# Installation
### Recommended system requirements:
- Virtualization: `KVM`/`Bare metal`
- Supported OS: `Centos` 7/8, `Debian` 9/10
- CPU: `1` cores 
  - `1` more core for every 500 next instances
- RAM: `2` Gb 
  - `1`Gb more RAM for every 500 next instances
- Disk space: `20` Gb 
  - `10`Gb more disk space for every 500 next instances
- Direct public ip address

### Data required for interfaces and modules
Before the installation process, you should prepare the following information:
- For interfaces **(**to use tools through any available interfaces**)**:
	- `Web`/`API` - DNS name for WEB and API (cld.example.com)
	- `Chat bot`:
    - Telegram bot token (http://t.me/BotFather)
    - Discord bot token (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
    - Extended license:
      - MatterMost url, port, team, bot token (https://example.com/yourteam/integrations/bots)
      - Slack app token, bot token (https://example.slack.com/apps/manage)

- For modules **(**to use modules functionality like create/resize/migrate KVM, create/delete/update DNS records, etc**)**:
	- `cm` - API credentials of supported bare metal hosting providers `OVH`/`Online.net`/`Hetzner`
	- `dns` - Credentianals of CloudFlare account (`login`, `API key`, `user ID`)
	- `zabbix` - Zabbix access credentials (`login`, `password`, `domain`, `url for Zabbix API`)

### Quick start
CLD should be installing on a **clean** OS, it is recommended to use `Centos` 8 Stream, because work in this distribution is very well tested in production
The installation is starting with the command:
```
bash -x <(wget -qO- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/classicdevops/cld/master/setup/install_cld.sh")
```

During the installation process, all init scripts of the system and modules will be executed, for each of them in interactive mode, you will need to specify the initialization data necessary for the operation of the system and modules
An example input will be provided for each type of data requested

Upon completion of the installation, a `password` for the `admin` user and a `link` to the `web interface` will be provided in console.
### Running via Docker
1. Build the image and export default credentials using the helper script:
   ```bash
   sudo ./docker/docker_init.sh /var/cld
   ```
   This exports the container's `/etc`, `/home`, and `/root` into `/var/cld/docker`.
   A default credentials file is created at `/var/cld/creds/creds_static` with a
   symlink `/var/cld/creds/creds` pointing to it.
2. Start the container using docker compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The compose file mounts `/var/cld` to `/var/cld`, `/var/cld/docker/etc` to `/etc`,
`/var/cld/docker/home` to `/home`, and `/var/cld/docker/root` to `/root`.
Ports `22`, `80` and `443` are exposed. The image runs sshd, nginx, cron and all
CLD services under Supervisor. Let’s Encrypt helper scripts placed under
`/root/sbin` handle automatic certificate generation for detected domains.

You can provide initial credentials through environment variables when running
the container. Any variable with the `CLD_CFG_` prefix will be written to
`/var/cld/creds/creds_env` and used instead of the default
`creds_static` file. For example:

```yaml
environment:
  - CLD_CFG_CLD_DOMAIN=cld.example.com
  - CLD_CFG_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret
```
